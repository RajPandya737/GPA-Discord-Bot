# GPA Discord Bot

Ever want to know what your GPA is without having to track every single assignment and grade? Well now you can with the GPA Discord Bot! This bot will calculate your GPA based on the grades you input. This bot is perfect for students who want to know what their GPA is or what they need to get in the future to achieve a certain GPA.

The bot is currently in development.



## How it works

The bot gets input from discord commands and saves them appropriately to a Mongo database. It can then retrieve this data when you want and perform numerical calcuilations to make it easier for you to see your GPA.
